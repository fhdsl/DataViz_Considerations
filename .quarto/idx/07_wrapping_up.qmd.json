The main question provided a list of candy (and a few joke non-candy items) to survey takers. The prompt asked\n\n>Basically, consider that feeling you get when you receive this item in your Halloween haul. Does it make you really happy (joy)? Or is it something that you automatically\nplace in the junk pile (despair)? Meh for indifference, and you can leave blank if you have no idea what the item is.\n\nUsing this [dataset](https://www.scq.ubc.ca/so-much-candy-data-seriously/), we focused on responses to the question about feelings related to specific candies, selecting only real candy, for a total of 77 candies. For each of these candies, we computed the proportion of respondents who replied with each general feeling (e.g., Joy, Despair, Indifference, or No response).\n\n#### R Code\n\n<details><summary>R code for data import and preliminary wrangling steps</summary>\n\n```{r warning = FALSE, message= FALSE}\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\ndf_2017 <- read.csv(here(\"data/candyhierarchy2017.csv\"), fileEncoding = \"ISO-8859-1\")\n\nnon_candy <- c(\"Bonkers  the board game\",\n               \"Box o Raisins\",\n               \"Broken glow stick\",\n               \"Cash  or other forms of legal tender\",\n               \"Chardonnay\",\n               \"Creepy Religious comics Chick Tracts\",\n               \"Dental paraphenalia\",\n               \"Generic Brand Acetaminophen\",\n               \"Glow sticks\",\n               \"Healthy Fruit\",\n               \"Hugs  actual physical hugs\",\n               \"JoyJoy  Mit Iodine\",\n               \"Kale smoothie\",\n               \"Green Party M M s\",\n               \"Independent M M s\",\n               \"Abstained from M M ing\",\n               \"Minibags of chips\",\n               \"Pencils\",\n               \"Real Housewives of Orange County Season 9 Blue Ray\",\n               \"Sandwich sized bags filled with BooBerry Crunch\",\n               \"Spotted Dick\",\n               \"Trail Mix\",\n               \"Vials of pure high fructose corn syrup  for main lining into your vein\",\n               \"Vicodin\",\n               \"White Bread\",\n               \"Whole Wheat anything\")\n\n#making a dataframe with just candy feeling responses\n## selecting columns related to Question 6 about feelings about candy.

However, to simplify the message we wish to communicate with our data visualization, we won't directly use these variables for this example.\n\n</details>\n\n:::\n\n<div class=\"notice\">\nTo review variables and different types of data, visit [Chapter 3](https://hutchdatascience.org/DataViz_Considerations/03_data.html#data-types)\n</div>\n\n### Goal\n\nOur goal is to visualize a ranking for the most liked candies in 2017 according to this dataset.\n\n```{r, fig.align = \"center\", echo = FALSE, out.width=\"100%\", fig.alt = \"This is an iterative example putting it all together.

Therefore we should probably consider plots types beyond the conventional ranking plots described in Chapter 4.\n\n**A more conventional approach**:\n\nA bar plot or even a stacked bar plot could work if we computed a single score (proportion of Joy - proportion of Despair perhaps), but with 77 candies, we would need to arrange the bars based on the magnitude or size and just focus on the bars on the extremes. The visualization would likely appear pretty cramped overall if we tried to show every candy.\n\n  * Here's an example of an analysis that utilized bar plots: [https://github.com/phoebewong/candy-hierarchy-2017](https://github.com/phoebewong/candy-hierarchy-2017). Notice, for this example they focused on a couple specific candies which gets around the \"cramped\" visualization concern.\n\n  * Similar to a bar plot is a lollipop chart (seems fitting for a candy dataset): [https://x.com/ttrodrigz/status/923582440937021440](https://x.com/ttrodrigz/status/923582440937021440). This example uses a log ratio rather than a difference for each candy, sorts based on magnitude, and then focuses on the extremes as expected.\n\n**A more unconventional approach**:\n\nA scatter plot is constructed with two numerical variables and is often used to show a correlation. We might expect our data to have some sort of a correlation because likely candy that is greatly enjoyed by many won't be despised by many. And conversely, candy that is despised by many probably won't be greatly enjoyed. The only way to see if this expectation is true is to explore the data and just plot it. So that's what we'll do for the first iteration.\n\n</details>\n\n:::\n\n<div class=\"notice\">\nTo review different conventional plot types, visit [Chapter 4](https://hutchdatascience.org/DataViz_Considerations/04_graph_info.html#standard-graph-types).\n</div>\n\n### Building the plot\n\nThe first few iterations will be an exploratory analysis of the data where we don't focus on aesthetics, but rather\n\n* what the data looks like\n* if patterns match our expectations\n* if our chosen plot style will work for us\n* perhaps even hypothesis or idea generation\n\nThen the remaining iterations will transition into polishing the visualization in order to prepare an expository data visualization.\n\n<div class=\"notice\">\nTo review the differences between exploratory and expository data visualizations, visit [Chapter 2](https://hutchdatascience.org/DataViz_Considerations/02_what_why_intro.html#what-is-data-visualization).\n</div>\n\n#### Iteration 1\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n##### Description\n\n```{r, fig.align = \"center\", echo = FALSE, out.width=\"100%\", fig.alt = \"Plotting the feelings dataset in a basic way with fraction of respondents who reported Joy on the x axis and fraction of respondents who reported despair on the y axis.

Both of these are done here to add clarity to this example.\n\n</details>\n\n:::\n\n::: {.emphasis_block}\n\n<div class=\"reflection\">\nSo far, this is just using 2 of the 3 main variables we identified.

The main question provided a list of candy (and a few joke non-candy items) to survey takers. The prompt asked\n\n>Basically, consider that feeling you get when you receive this item in your Halloween haul. Does it make you really happy (joy)? Or is it something that you automatically\nplace in the junk pile (despair)? Meh for indifference, and you can leave blank if you have no idea what the item is.\n\nUsing this [dataset](https://www.scq.ubc.ca/so-much-candy-data-seriously/), we focused on responses to the question about feelings related to specific candies, selecting only real candy, for a total of 77 candies. For each of these candies, we computed the proportion of respondents who replied with each general feeling (e.g., Joy, Despair, Indifference, or No response).\n\n#### R Code\n\n<details><summary>R code for data import and preliminary wrangling steps</summary>\n\n```{r warning = FALSE, message= FALSE}\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\ndf_2017 <- read.csv(here(\"data/candyhierarchy2017.csv\"), fileEncoding = \"ISO-8859-1\")\n\nnon_candy <- c(\"Bonkers  the board game\",\n               \"Box o Raisins\",\n               \"Broken glow stick\",\n               \"Cash  or other forms of legal tender\",\n               \"Chardonnay\",\n               \"Creepy Religious comics Chick Tracts\",\n               \"Dental paraphenalia\",\n               \"Generic Brand Acetaminophen\",\n               \"Glow sticks\",\n               \"Healthy Fruit\",\n               \"Hugs  actual physical hugs\",\n               \"JoyJoy  Mit Iodine\",\n               \"Kale smoothie\",\n               \"Green Party M M s\",\n               \"Independent M M s\",\n               \"Abstained from M M ing\",\n               \"Minibags of chips\",\n               \"Pencils\",\n               \"Real Housewives of Orange County Season 9 Blue Ray\",\n               \"Sandwich sized bags filled with BooBerry Crunch\",\n               \"Spotted Dick\",\n               \"Trail Mix\",\n               \"Vials of pure high fructose corn syrup  for main lining into your vein\",\n               \"Vicodin\",\n               \"White Bread\",\n               \"Whole Wheat anything\")\n\n#making a dataframe with just candy feeling responses\n## selecting columns related to Question 6 about feelings about candy.

Therefore we should probably consider plots types beyond the conventional ranking plots described in Chapter 4.\n\n**A more conventional approach**:\n\nA bar plot or even a stacked bar plot could work if we computed a single score (proportion of Joy - proportion of Despair perhaps), but with 77 candies, we would need to arrange the bars based on the magnitude or size and just focus on the bars on the extremes. The visualization would likely appear pretty cramped overall if we tried to show every candy.\n\n  * Here's an example of an analysis that utilized bar plots: [https://github.com/phoebewong/candy-hierarchy-2017](https://github.com/phoebewong/candy-hierarchy-2017). Notice, for this example they focused on a couple specific candies which gets around the \"cramped\" visualization concern.\n\n  * Similar to a bar plot is a lollipop chart (seems fitting for a candy dataset): [https://x.com/ttrodrigz/status/923582440937021440](https://x.com/ttrodrigz/status/923582440937021440). This example uses a log ratio rather than a difference for each candy, sorts based on magnitude, and then focuses on the extremes as expected.\n\n**A more unconventional approach**:\n\nA scatter plot is constructed with two numerical variables and is often used to show a correlation. We might expect our data to have some sort of a correlation because likely candy that is greatly enjoyed by many won't be despised by many. And conversely, candy that is despised by many probably won't be greatly enjoyed. The only way to see if this expectation is true is to explore the data and just plot it. So that's what we'll do for the first iteration.\n\n</details>\n\n:::\n\n<div class=\"notice\">\nTo review different conventional plot types, visit [Chapter 4](https://hutchdatascience.org/DataViz_Considerations/04_graph_info.html#standard-graph-types).\n</div>\n\n### Building the plot\n\nThe first few iterations will be an exploratory analysis of the data where we don't focus on aesthetics, but rather\n\n* what the data looks like\n* if patterns match our expectations\n* if our chosen plot style will work for us\n* perhaps even hypothesis or idea generation\n\nThen the remaining iterations will transition into polishing the visualization in order to prepare an expository data visualization.\n\n<div class=\"notice\">\nTo review the differences between exploratory and expository data visualizations, visit [Chapter 2](https://hutchdatascience.org/DataViz_Considerations/02_what_why_intro.html#what-is-data-visualization).\n</div>\n\n#### Iteration 1\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n##### Description\n\n```{r, fig.align = \"center\", echo = FALSE, out.width=\"100%\", fig.alt = \"Plotting the feelings dataset in a basic way with fraction of respondents who reported Joy on the x axis and fraction of respondents who reported despair on the y axis.

As discussed in [Chapter 5](https://hutchdatascience.org/DataViz_Considerations/04_how_to_improve_viz.html#accessibility-considerations), to enhance accessibility, we don't want to rely on color alone to distinguish groups. So we'll also use shape to distinguish the groups. This is a bit redundant but can be beneficial to our future audience.\n\n##### R code\n\n```{r}\nto_plot %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x=JOY,\n             y = DESPAIR,\n             color = Chocolate,\n             shape = Chocolate)) + #<6>\n  geom_point() +\n  xlim(0, 1) +\n  ylim(0, 1) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(x = \"Fraction of respondents who reported JOY\",\n       y = \"Fraction of respondents who reported DESPAIR\") +\n  theme(text = element_text(size = 14))\n```\n\n6.

Viewers need to a quick way to know the signifiance of where the data points are with respect to the dashed lines.\n\nThis step is an example of how sometimes there is no \"single right choice\" when it comes to data visualization. Labeling the quadrants could be done in several ways. And if you're in a setting where peak professionalism isn't necessary, you could even have some fun here -- perhaps using emojis instead of words!\n\n#### Iteration 11\n\n```{r, fig.align = \"center\", echo = FALSE, out.width=\"100%\"}\nottrpal::include_slide(\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fu-KfdN2ldOXB49o9zdpurFbVvl1bOh8cfQ3vu0szk4/edit?slide=id.g3be338b6b90_0_125#slide=id.g3be338b6b90_0_125\")\n```\n\n```{r, fig.align = \"center\", echo = FALSE, out.width=\"100%\"}\nottrpal::include_slide(\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fu-KfdN2ldOXB49o9zdpurFbVvl1bOh8cfQ3vu0szk4/edit?slide=id.g3bb275f27df_0_0#slide=id.g3bb275f27df_0_0\")\n```\n\n#### Iteration 12\n\n```{r, fig.align = \"center\", echo = FALSE, out.width=\"100%\"}\nottrpal::include_slide(\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fu-KfdN2ldOXB49o9zdpurFbVvl1bOh8cfQ3vu0szk4/edit?slide=id.g3be338b6b90_0_120#slide=id.g3be338b6b90_0_120\")\n```\n\n#### Iteration 13\n\n```{r, fig.align = \"center\", echo = FALSE, out.width=\"100%\"}\nottrpal::include_slide(\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fu-KfdN2ldOXB49o9zdpurFbVvl1bOh8cfQ3vu0szk4/edit?slide=id.g3be338b6b90_0_87#slide=id.g3be338b6b90_0_87\")\n```\n\n#### Iteration 14\n\n```{r, fig.align = \"center\", echo = FALSE, out.width=\"100%\"}\nottrpal::include_slide(\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fu-KfdN2ldOXB49o9zdpurFbVvl1bOh8cfQ3vu0szk4/edit?slide=id.g3be338b6b90_0_138#slide=id.g3be338b6b90_0_138\")\n```\n\n#### Iteration 15\n\n```{r, fig.align = \"center\", echo = FALSE, out.width=\"100%\"}\nottrpal::include_slide(\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fu-KfdN2ldOXB49o9zdpurFbVvl1bOh8cfQ3vu0szk4/edit?slide=id.g3be338b6b90_0_92#slide=id.g3be338b6b90_0_92\")\n```\n\n```{r, fig.align = \"center\", echo = FALSE, out.width=\"100%\"}\nottrpal::include_slide(\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fu-KfdN2ldOXB49o9zdpurFbVvl1bOh8cfQ3vu0szk4/edit?slide=id.g3c26f54f9da_0_0#slide=id.g3c26f54f9da_0_0\")\n```\n\n#### Iteration 16\n\n```{r, fig.align = \"center\", echo = FALSE, out.width=\"100%\"}\nottrpal::include_slide(\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fu-KfdN2ldOXB49o9zdpurFbVvl1bOh8cfQ3vu0szk4/edit?slide=id.g3be338b6b90_0_105#slide=id.g3be338b6b90_0_105\")\n```\n\n#### Iteration 17\n\n```{r, fig.align = \"center\", echo = FALSE, out.width=\"100%\"}\nottrpal::include_slide(\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fu-KfdN2ldOXB49o9zdpurFbVvl1bOh8cfQ3vu0szk4/edit?slide=id.g3be338b6b90_0_133#slide=id.g3be338b6b90_0_133\")\n```\n\n#### Iteration 18\n\n```{r, fig.align = \"center\", echo = FALSE, out.width=\"100%\"}\nottrpal::include_slide(\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fu-KfdN2ldOXB49o9zdpurFbVvl1bOh8cfQ3vu0szk4/edit?slide=id.g3bb275f27df_0_40#slide=id.g3bb275f27df_0_40\")\n```\n\n#### Iteration 19\n\n```{r, fig.align = \"center\", echo = FALSE, out.width=\"100%\"}\nottrpal::include_slide(\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fu-KfdN2ldOXB49o9zdpurFbVvl1bOh8cfQ3vu0szk4/edit?slide=id.g3bb275f27df_0_31#slide=id.g3bb275f27df_0_31\")\n```\n\n#### Iteration 20\n\n```{r, fig.align = \"center\", echo = FALSE, out.width=\"100%\"}\nottrpal::include_slide(\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fu-KfdN2ldOXB49o9zdpurFbVvl1bOh8cfQ3vu0szk4/edit?slide=id.g3be338b6b90_0_99#slide=id.g3be338b6b90_0_99\")\n```\n\n```{r, fig.align = \"center\", echo = FALSE, out.width=\"100%\"}\nottrpal::include_slide(\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fu-KfdN2ldOXB49o9zdpurFbVvl1bOh8cfQ3vu0szk4/edit?slide=id.g3c26f54f9da_0_8#slide=id.g3c26f54f9da_0_8\")\n```\n\n#### The plot!\n\n```{r, fig.align = \"center\", echo = FALSE, out.width=\"100%\"}\nottrpal::include_slide(\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fu-KfdN2ldOXB49o9zdpurFbVvl1bOh8cfQ3vu0szk4/edit?slide=id.g3be338b6b90_0_146#slide=id.g3be338b6b90_0_146\")\n```\n\nBut we're not done yet....\n\n#### The caption!\n\n```{r, fig.align = \"center\", echo = FALSE, out.width=\"100%\"}\nottrpal::include_slide(\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fu-KfdN2ldOXB49o9zdpurFbVvl1bOh8cfQ3vu0szk4/edit?slide=id.g3bb275f27df_0_20#slide=id.g3bb275f27df_0_20\")\n```\n\n#### Going further\n\nThe dataset is an open dataset meaning that it is available for you to explore and visualize on your own!\n\nPerhaps you are interested in whether there's a difference in rankings depending on the sex of respondent or some other demographics. Do males prefer chocolate over non-chocolate candy? Does the age or location of the respondent impact the rankings?\n\nPerhaps you are interested in how the proportion of indifference affects these rankings. Is there a design element that can be added to this plot to visualize that specifically?\n\nPerhaps you'd like to try to plot this with a completely different plot type! Whatever your question -- go for it! Practice is one of the best ways to improve your data visualization skills.\n\n## In Summary\n\nAim for understanding and readability over complexity. When you are working with your data and selecting your plot, think about what message you want to communicate.\n\n\n## Checklist\n\nThis checklist contains reminders of considerations and steps you should take while building your expository data visualization in order to minimize its complexity, enhance its clarity and accessibility, and assess its accuracy.\n\n## Keep Practicing!\n\nGive some examples\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":true,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":true,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["assets/style_ITN.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"07_wrapping_up.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
