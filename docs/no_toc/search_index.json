"],["introduction.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Motivation 1.2 Target audience 1.3 Curriculum 1.4 Objectives", " Chapter 1 Introduction This course is meant to discuss best practices when constructing data visualizations with a special focus on graphs within biology research. 1.1 Motivation Data is now used more than ever to evaluate and understand questions across many fields including pubic health, bioinformatics, and clinical research. It is critical to produce effective visual summaries of our data. Data visualization is useful for exploration, validation, and presentation of research, aiding in the understanding of underlying biology in datasets, debugging errors in informatics workflows, and identifying/avoiding sources of bias. This course is designed to introduce key concepts of data visualization, in particular for visualizing complex data and accessibility. In addition we will point to additional resources. 1.2 Target audience The course is intended for anyone who has an interest in data visualization, but contains sections of specific interest for cancer researchers with experience using basic informatics tools. 1.3 Curriculum The course covers why data visualizations are important for communication within the biomedical and bioinformatics fields as well as best practices and design principles that researchers should consider when constructing data visualizations for their work. 1.4 Objectives "],["defining-data-visualization.html", "Chapter 2 Defining Data Visualization 2.1 Learning Objectives 2.2 What is Data Visualization? 2.3 Need for Data Visualization 2.4 Summary", " Chapter 2 Defining Data Visualization 2.1 Learning Objectives 2.2 What is Data Visualization? Data visualization is the process (verb) or end product (noun) of making graphical representations such as plots or other figures to show different representations of information, to both explore or communicate aspects such as trends, patterns, relationships, or steps in a process. A data visualization may show every data point within a dataset (raw data), or it may show transformations, subsets, statistical summaries, confidence intervals, or estimates of relationships between variables within the dataset. It may represent data using graphics such as points, lines, bars, area/size, color, shape, or some combination of these. Visualizations can also be used to provide an overview of a process, rather than displaying specific data. By whatever means the information is displayed, a complete or polished data visualization will also include design elements beyond graphics: informative text such as titles, axis labels, annotations or direct labeling, and captions. These are the building blocks of graphical representation of data. They may be combined in specific ways to form standard plot formats such as scatter plots, pie charts, bar plots, histograms, and more (with even more specialized formats used in certain industries and research fields - e.g., Sankey Diagrams, Forest Plots, Kaplan-Meier Curves, etc.). Tables are another fundamental form of data visualization even though they don’t have the same visual appeal of a plot or figure. Tables summarize data in a structured manner, displaying specific information and enabling detailed comparisons. They may include graphics such as icons or color, but primarily utilize text within a grid-like format. A table may be stand alone or accompany a plot to provide a more complete picture. There are two main types of data visualizations: Exploratory and Expository visualizations. This course will focus on best practices in preparing expository visualizations. 2.2.1 Exploratory Visualizations Exploratory visualizations are made during Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). These visualizations are made quickly and will not be shared widely outside of your team. EDA and exploratory visualizations are useful for: Exploring a dataset Data wrangling: Determining how to reorganize or clean a dataset (checking for missing data, data miscodings etc.) Checking that your reorganizing or cleaning of a dataset worked correctly Sketching any necessary quality control or transformation steps Validating that you have the necessary data to answer your question Exploring a dataset Exploring a dataset involves looking at the data. Sometimes this is just visually inspecting the data and other times its creating plots to look at aspects of a variable or how variables relate to each other. You’ll primarily be looking to see what data is there, if anything is missing, how the data is encoded/how it appears, if you have all the variables/features you need, and how variables relate to each other. Visualizations that will be useful for exploring a dataset include any plot showing distributions (violin, boxplot, stem and leaf, etc.), tables, heatmaps, line plots, and scatter plots. Steps to consider for exploring a dataset Look at the beginning of the dataset: For tabular data, are the header names present/correct? Is the data separated correctly? Does the data appear how or contain what you would expect? (e.g., DNA sequences, numbers, pixels, etc.) Look at the end of the dataset: Is there unintended information included at the end? Does the file end where you would expect or is data potentially missing/wasn’t transferred? What’s the size of the dataset? For tabular data, is the number of rows and columns what you would expect? Is the file size correct or was data lost in any transfer steps? Look for missing data How is missing data encoded (e.g., how it appears or what it looks like)? “NA”, “NULL”, “999”, “-1”, blank, etc.? What variables have missing data? Is the data missing at random or is there some pattern? Are some variables missing data together? Or inversely (e.g., one variable has data when the other doesn’t)? Will you drop missing data or impute it? How does your action change the dataset? Look at the variables you have Are there any variables that should be there that aren’t such as possible confounders or covariates? If so, can you use data that is there to define that information? Do you know units or other important information (e.g what does 0/1 stand for in a categorical column) ? For numerical variables … What are the minimum and maximum values? Do these match your expectations? What do the distributions look like? Identity, skew, modality, etc. … do these match your expectations? Are there outlier values? Are these biologically real or could they be data entry errors? Look for trends or correlations Data wrangling Any missing data, variables that you need to create using other (present) variable(s), recodings, or possible data entry errors that you found while exploring the dataset are going to be pertinent for data wrangling. Additionally, it’ll be useful to create tables or bar charts that count entries for certain variables, especially for any free text or manual entry data. Consider a text variable that represents attending physician: “Abraham Simpson”. Entries may include “AJS” (initials), “Simpson”, “Abe Simpson”, “Abraham Simpon” (misspelling). All of these represent the same physician and would need their values synchronized/corrected. Quality Control or Transformation Possible quality control or transformation steps include Perform a principal component analysis (PCA) and make related plots (a variance explained elbow plot, embeddings scatter plot, loadings heatmap, etc.). Do any variables need rounded down, rounded up, log transformed (to spread close values)? How do distributions change after you’ve done that? Validate that you have the necessary data to answer your question Perform a preliminary analysis aiming to answer your question. Do you have enough data (or the right data) to answer the question? Are the results what you expected? Do they appear how you expected? Does a preliminary quick plot of the results seem like something that can communicate the results to others (once you’ve polished it and made some aesthetic changes)? Exploratory visualizations and EDA allow for researchers to explore their data and validate that it is the correct data to answer the research question. You should spend very little time making each exploratory plot. The large amount of time EDA takes, instead, is the result of making a lot of visualizations and thoroughly exploring the dataset. The time you take at the beginning of an analysis to explore the dataset and truly understand and wrangle what is there, saves a lot of time in the end because you can request more data or make any necessary corrections before you perform the data analysis and build up your expository visualizations. 2.2.2 Expository Visualizations Expository visualizations are polished visualizations prepared for the purpose of sharing. You may share an expository visualization within a preprint, a peer-reviewed publication, on a poster, or as part of a presentation. Because expository visualizations will be shared widely, you will not always be there to present or explain the visualization to others. Therefore, you want to design your data visualization to stand alone. With this goal in mind, an important part of creating an expository visualization also includes writing the narrative to go along with it. This narrative may involve an informative title, well-labeled axes, a thorough caption, and alternative text. Note that not all formats require each of these elements to appear alongside the visualization. You won’t put a caption on your presentation slide, however you may want to include the caption within the speaker notes. Specific tips for a high quality narrative Ensure the title states the plot’s main conclusion Avoid using field specific jargon or obscure acronyms within a title or an axis label unless defined (perhaps within the caption). Include sufficient detail in your axis for people to understand what your plot is trying to show Additionally, because an expository visualization will be shared widely, the audience will be broad and have varied interests and expertise. If you are giving a semi-frequent presentation within your department or lab group or presenting within a session at a specialized conference, you can expect the audience to be somewhat familiar with the topic. However, no one will know your research like you do. Many others may see the visualization outside of your lab, department, or institution – perhaps even patients and their family members, or other members of the public! Therefore, you want to prepare your expository visualizations in a way that they will be accessible to a larger audience. Creating a good expository visualization will take time. Data visualization is often an iterative process both as you prepare the plot and as you seek and incorporate feedback from your team. Be sure to carefully inspect and validate your visualization before sharing it widely. A common phrase within home maintenance and improvement communities is “Measure twice, cut once”. As you prepare your expository visualization, you want to check it twice before you share it the first time. 2.3 Need for Data Visualization Datasets are becoming increasingly large and complex. Well-made data visualizations efficiently summarize and display data, providing a more approachable view of the complex information. Rather than writing many paragraphs of text to explain the dataset and analyses performed, creating data visualizations can streamline the necessary accompanying narrative by showing the data and relationships contained within. Visualizations are very useful in displaying outliers, trends, patterns, relationships, steps in a process, or changes over time. Each of these could be explained with words, but they will be more compelling and more easily comprehensible to an audience when they see them with their own eyes; the old marketing phrase “A picture is worth a thousand words” succinctly conveys how audiences benefit from visuals. However, remember that an expository data visualization that is meant to be shared widely should have words with it: the declarative title, informative axis labels, or context on where the data came from and how it was handled. Visualizations play a strong role in helping audiences interact with and understand the data being presented. People have limited time to interact with others’ work and analyses, especially for topics outside of their interest or expertise. They may skim an abstract or part of an article, but their eyes will likely be drawn to images. Visualizations that are frustrating, misleading, not accessible, or not easily understood will cause more harm than good, but making compelling visualizations that can be effectively understood at a glance helps you to communicate your research to others. 2.4 Summary Data visualizations efficiently summarize and display data. Exploratory data visualizations are used by a researcher to explore and better understand their data, but are internal visualizations that are made quickly and are not polished. In contrast, expository data visualizations communicate a researcher’s point in a polished and more approachable way than just a descriptive paragraph would. Making a high quality expository data visualization to share widely often requires several design and refinement iterations. Expository visualizations should stand alone, using accompanying descriptive and informative text to communicate the point without live narration or explanation from the researcher. Finally, researchers should double check their expository visualizations for accuracy, effectiveness, and accessibility before sharing widely. "],["elements-of-data-visualization.html", "Chapter 3 Elements of Data Visualization 3.1 Learning Objectives 3.2 Data Types 3.3 Data Encodings 3.4 Coordinate System 3.5 Summary", " Chapter 3 Elements of Data Visualization A data visualization represents data in a simplified way. The visualization is made up of the represented data as well as the means by which the data is represented: textual and graphical design elements. Each conventional plot type utilizes a combination of design elements in a predictable way or layout. Because the design elements are the building blocks for the data visualizations, an important step in choosing an appropriate plot for your data is considering what your data is and how it can be encoded or represented. 3.1 Learning Objectives 3.2 Data Types A dataset is a collection of records or observations. This course assumes that the dataset you are going to visualize has been processed and wrangled such that it is a “structured dataset.” In structured datasets, typically each row (or “record”) contains observations for a single sample or patient. Each column is a different observation or variable for that sample or patient. Every variable will be unique either because different things are being measured or documented or because the same thing is being measured at different time points. When thinking about the amount of data that will be displayed in a visualization, there are two different considerations: the number of observations (the number of rows) and the number of variables (which and how many columns). Wide vs Long datasets Some datasets may utilize a “long” approach to stack similar variables on top of each other with a new column helping to distinguish them and repeating record IDs across multiple rows; but this “long” approach is typically used as input to visualization software. There are two main types of data within a dataset: numerical and categorical data. A dataset will likely have a mixture of these data types and new variables may be generated using the original data through transformations. Transformations can be used by performing mathematical operations or converting between data types. Converting numerical data into categorical data is accomplished through binning or by employing a cutoff value. Alternatively, categorical data may need to be encoded as numerals so the data is in a form that requires less storage or so that a computer or algorithm can process it (e.g., machine readable). There may be more specialized data types depending on your research question, such as relational or spatial data, but these tend to be just more complex and more defined format versions of numerical and categorical data. 3.2.1 Numerical Data Numerical data is data that quantitatively represents some count or measurement. Mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, exponentiation, etc. are appropriate. There are two subtypes of numerical data: discrete and continuous. Whole numbers or integers (e.g., 103 and 25,975) are examples of discrete data while decimals (e.g., 98.6 and 32.25) are examples of continuous data. Examples of numerical data within the biomedical field include a blood test result value or concentration a patient’s age the thickness of a tumor the length of stay for a patient at the hospital a survival probability 3.2.2 Categorical Data Categorical data qualitatively characterizes, categorizes, or groups objects or individuals with labels. Categorical data sometimes may look like numbers when they are group IDs or some sort of ranking or index score. However, A-B-C could be switched out for 1-2-3 making such data categorical data. Survey data frequently has categorical data that appears as numbers because responses are typically “coded”. This is especially true for biomedical data from platforms like REDCap. There are two subtypes of categorical data: nominal and ordinal. Nominal data is data that can’t be ordered, for example “Case” and “Control”. Ordinal data is data that can be ordered, for example “A”, “B”, “C” or “January 14, 1994”, “February 8, 1995”, “March 18, 1996”. While you may be able to do some arithmetic operations with ordinal data specifically (like finding an average ranking or finding the distance between numerically encoded categories), typically arithmetic operations aren’t appropriate for categorical data and shouldn’t be used because the numbers don’t have mathematical meaning. Index scores particularly should be treated like categorical data given that they represent categories. However, they often have order to them (are ordinal) and therefore, because the index or score is fundamentally a number, it’s made up of other numbers and can be tracked over time, etc. Examples of categorical data within the biomedical field include patient or sample IDs treatment group patient sex tumor location Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) Score / depression severity level Charlson-Deyo Comorbidity Index 3.3 Data Encodings Data encoding is the process of representing data using visual elements or graphical attributes. These include geometric marks and visual channels which are the building blocks of data visualization. Different graph types utilize different encodings to represent data. Geometric marks are typically the primary means of representing data across graph types while the visual channels are usually used as secondary or supplementary methods (e.g., shape, color, and textures). However, color can be a primary means of data encoding for certain graphs like heatmaps or choropleths . 3.3.1 Geometric Marks These building blocks are also referred to as “geometric marks” and they include points lines bars area angle Points An example of a conventional plot type that uses points is a scatter plot. Points typically are circles but can be other shapes (like triangles or squares), and typically represent one person or sample. Lines An example of a conventional plot type that uses lines is a line plot. Lines connect different data points. Slope may be a value of interest when working with lines, but it’s often difficult for audiences to compare slope values visually without labels. Lines may also be trendlines that aren’t connecting explicit data points and rather are included in a plot to showcase a general relationship or trend. Lines are often used to indicate summary statistics such as averages as well as medians or quartiles (in boxplots). Bars Bars use height (vertical bars) or length (horizontal bars) to communicate information about a set of samples. Within bar charts, width typically isn’t used to communicate information about data, but for plot types like flow diagrams or histograms, bar width does convey a meaningful value. Area Area is often proportional to the amount of data its representing rather than the raw data values itself. Larger areas correspond to larger data values. Area is commonly used in density plots. Angles Angles are most commonly used to represent numerical values such as proportions but can also be used to represent direction rather than just magnitude/size (through use of arrows or slope). Angles are the primary geometric mark used in pie charts. 3.3.2 Visual Channels These visual building blocks are also referred to as “visual channels” and they control the way that the geometric building blocks will appear. You can change the shape, color, or size of a point, but it’s still a point. Visual channels include: position color shape line type patterns size tilt Position Position often reflects numerical value with marks that are near each other having more similar values than marks that are further away. Position may also be used to separate different categories where the general order or position may reflect similar categories, the same parent category, or a numerical variable that is being compared across variables. Color Color may reflect categorization or group membership. Color may control the appearance of any of the geometric marks. Shape Shape may reflect categorization or group membership and controls the way that points appear. Shape is sometimes used in place of or as a supplement to color. Line Type Line types can be used much like shape to communicate categorization or group membership. Line type controls the appearance of lines. Pattern Pattern is sometimes used in place of or as a supplement to color to reflect categorization or group membership. For the recurring pattern to be recognized, it often needs to be used with geometric marks that have enough area for the pattern to be distinguishable (such as bars). Size Size is used to encode quantitative data by altering physical attributes of the geometric marks: thickness of a line, radius of a point, etc. Changes in size are often proportional to the quantitative data with larger sizes corresponding to larger values. Tilt Tilt is another word for angles and can be used as a visual channel, not just a geometric mark. Tilt is used to represent proportions or trends (such as slope). While helpful for comparisons, audiences often find it difficult to compare tilt precisely and designers should not rely on tilt to communicate main messages. 3.3.3 Preattentive Attributes Several of the visual channels are considered “Preattentive attributes” which means that they are visual features that the human brain tends to process quickly and unconsciously such that a viewer is instinctively guided to focus their attention on that feature. This is often due to contrast or differences in the feature compared to everything else. Examples include: Bars that are obviously taller than the rest Mostly one dominant color, but a few data points are a different, more vibrant or contrasting color Only one data point is outlined One line is wider than the rest 3.3.4 Additional Design Tools These additional design tools may or may not encode data, but do separate out data to enhance clarity and interpretability. The actual group membership will affect what is labeled or separated out, but often other visual design channels (like color) may be used to communicate group membership in a redundant way. These design tools are especially effective at improving the clarity of a visualization without having to change plot types. So if you’re building a data visualization and it’s a little too cluttered or difficult to interpret, try utilizing one of these design tools before switching plot types to a more complex plot type. labels facets or subplots transparency Labels Labels include axis labels, titles, and direct annotations within the plot perhaps specifying a specific summary statistic/number or pointing out the name/value of a specific data point or line. They may be combined with dashed lines, colors, or other visual channels to provide further clarity. Subplots Subplots, also known as faceting, subplots separates out the data into different panels based on group membership. The same plot type will be utilized in each panel. Panels may or may not use the same scaling and axis limits. Transparency Transparency controls the opacity of the geometric marks. If an area appears less transparent, there is a greater density of data there than areas that appear more transparent. This visual channel is especially helpful to distinguish groups that overlap. 3.4 Coordinate System Most data visualizations will utilize a two dimensional XY coordinate system (or Cartesian plane) with a horizontal (x-) axis and a vertical (y-) axis that are perpendicular and intersect where x = 0 and y = 0. Each variable will be assigned to one of the axes. If working with regression or where you have a dependent variable (outcome or event being measured or observed) and an independent variable (the variable being controlled or changed/purposefully manipulated), the independent variable is assigned to the x-axis and the dependent variable is assigned to the y-axis. When working with numerical data, this XY coordinate system allows for the positioning of the numerical data along these axes. When working with a categorical data, the categories can still be positioned along of the numerical axes, however the corresponding numerical positions will not have the same meaning they would otherwise have. The two axes can utilize different units (e..g, micrograms per milliliter, percentage, grams, log fold change, etc.) and scales, however, if the same units are used for the two axes, then the scaling should be equal for both axes to avoid distortion. Additional coordinate systems Additional coordinate systems are appropriate for some specific visualizations such as a three dimensional XYZ coordinate system, the polar coordinate system (e.g., pie charts and spider charts), and a geospatial coordinate system for maps such as the projected coordinate system. The XYZ coordinate system utilizes a third axis (z-) that intersects the XY-plane perpendicularly at x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0. The polar coordinate system uses angles to position groups and radii length to represent magnitude or group size. A projected coordinate system is a two dimensional map. 3.5 Summary Data has two main subdivisions: numeric and categorical data. Each type of data has certain geometric marks and visual channels that best represent that type of data. Categorical data communicates qualitative information such as groups, categorizations, or rankings and is best represented by color and shape as well as line type or patterns. Position may also be used for categorical data though position is typically associated with numerical data. Numerical data communicates quantitative information such as a measurement, count, or other numerical value perhaps the result of a mathematical operation. "],["choosing-the-right-plot.html", "Chapter 4 Choosing the Right Plot 4.1 Learning Objectives 4.2 Goals of Data Visualization 4.3 Standard Graph Types 4.4 Galleries 4.5 Summary", " Chapter 4 Choosing the Right Plot A data visualization represents data in a simplified way by encoding that data with textual and graphical design elements which are then combined in a specific layout. Each plot type has a certain combination of the design elements and an associated typical configuration. The design elements act as building blocks for the overall data visualizations. Therefore, deciding which design elements and plot type to use depends on: The type(s) and amount of data that you’re visualizing the question you are trying to answer or message you want to communicate The previous chapter discussed the types of data and how those are encoded or appropriate visual design elements to represent certain types of data. This chapter discusses the questions typical visualizations can answer and puts together all of the considerations in describing standard plot types. 4.1 Learning Objectives 4.2 Goals of Data Visualization There are many different possible goals for creating a data visualization. Among those include looking at a distribution showing a correlation or other relationship between variables finding a ranking displaying change over time or after an intervention indicating location and spatial relationships or distributions 4.3 Standard Graph Types Standard graph types include conventional graphs like histograms, scatter plots, bar plots, and line charts as well as other graphs used to look at distributions or find rankings or used to consider group composition, complex relationships, and response. For the conventional plots, this section will describe the appropriate kinds and amount of data needed to use that plot type as well as questions that plot type can be used to answer. For the graphs beyond those four, additional information will be provided such as a description, strengths, weaknesses, and alternative plots. 4.3.1 Conventional Graphs Conventional graph types include histograms, scatter plots, bar plots, and line charts. Each of these are used to answer a different question. Histogram Scatter plot Bar plot Line chart Primary type of data Numerical Numerical Numerical &amp; Categorical Numerical Minimum number of variables 1 2 2 2 Primary data encoding Area and Position Point and Position Area &amp; Labels/Position Line and Position Goal looking at a distribution showing a correlation finding a ranking displaying change over time Additional data and data encodings for conventional graph types A histogram may visualize more than one distribution within the same visualization. In that case, the dataset will have categorical data and more than one variable. Such a visualization would likely incorporate color or patterns and should increase opacity/transparency. A scatter plot may have categorical data that can be encoded with shape or color. Any additional numerical variables beyond the minimum of 2 (one for the x-axis and one for the y-axis) could be encoded with size or color (using a sequential color palette). A bar plot tends to have categories and counts for those categories (two variables, one categorical and one numerical), though a dataset may have just the categories which would need to be counted (which some visualization software can do this for the researcher). Additional data could represent some grouping or categorization of the categorical data (another categorical variable) in which case color may be used to encode that additional variable. A line chart may or may not use points in addition to lines. It is good practice for the researcher to display the data points and not just the lines connecting them. If the dataset contains additional variables beyond the minimum of 2 (one for the x-axis and one for the y-axis), categorical data could be encoded with shape or color while numerical data could be encoded with size or color (using a sequential color palette). 4.3.2 Ranking and Distribution Plots Of the conventional plots described above, bar plots and histograms both fit within this category. Bar plots are typically used to find a ranking while histograms display a distribution. Ranking and distribution plots are often, but not exclusively, used for exploratory data analysis and internal visualizations. If presented as an expository visualization, these plots will usually supplement or support a more complex figure, perhaps as a subpanel within that larger figure. Even if ranking and distribution plots are rarely the focal point, they are a powerful tool in the researcher’s data visualization toolbox to profile data characteristics and compare groups. Violin Plots Description: Displays the density of data where narrow sections correspond to lower density and wider sections correspond to higher density. The plots generally resemble the outline of a violin. When to use: Numerical data (may have categorical data if looking at multiple distributions) Minimum of 1 variable Best with minimal number of categories Primary data encodings are area and position Used to show distributions and rank groups Strengths: Better at comparing multiple distributions than histograms (the conventional plot type) Displays distribution shape such as skew and modes better than boxplots do Weaknesses: Doesn’t show individual data points Limited usefulness when there’s little amounts of data (e.g., few records/patients/samples) The method for creating the density visualization is a bit arbitrary Alternatives: Boxplot (especially with jitter to show individual data points) Ridgeline plot Raincloud plot Example plot Example of the plot in the biomedical, bioinformatics, or cancer informatics literature Figure 5c in this paper showing the expression of a tumor suppressor gene based on the genotype of an eQTL associated SNP: https://www-nature-com.fhcrc.idm.oclc.org/articles/s41586-024-07708-2. Boxplots (with jitter) Description: Boxplots use a box to delineate the median and quartiles of the data with whiskers to display the range and potentially points for outliers. A “jitter” can be utilized to include points for each data point. Jitter and Randomness Inclusion of jitter typically uses randomness to space the points over the box so you may need to set a random seed in your analysis to ensure the visualization appears exactly one way consistently. However, it’s not a major problem if the jitter points move on a plot as they’ll have the same numerical axis location, only moving within the categorical axis. When to use: Numerical data (may have categorical data if looking at multiple distributions) Minimum of 1 variable Best if used with intermediate to large sample sizes Primary data encodings are lines and points Used to show distributions and rank groups Strengths: Shows the data as well as helpful summary statistics and overall variation Can quickly spot outliers Can compare groups efficiently Weaknesses: Doesn’t show multiple modes as well as violin plots Quartiles may not be familiar concepts for general audiences Outliers need further investigation Alternatives: Violin plot Histogram Ridgeline plot Strip plot (shows the individual data points only) Raincloud plot Swarm plot Example plot Ridgeline Plots Description: Shows the distribution of multiple categories of numerical data, using densities (half a violin). Looks like stacked, but slightly offset mountain ridges. When to use: Numerical data (with categorical data for groups) Minimum of 2 variables Best with a higher number of categories Primary data encodings are area and position Used to show distributions and rank groups Strengths: Efficiently displays distributions for many groups or categories Shows distribution shape (e.g., skew and modes) Weaknesses: Can be cluttered if there is too much overlap between groups or not a clear ordering of the categories Good for general comparison among groups, but not for finding precise quantitative differences The method for creating the density visualizations is a bit arbitrary Alternatives: Boxplot (especially with jitter to show individual data points) Strip plot In some cases, a sorted heatmap A table may be better if you need to make quantitative comparisons Example plot Raincloud Plots Description: Combines 3 plots: density, boxplot, individual data points. Generally looks like a raining cloud. When to use: Numerical data (with categorical data for groups) Minimum of 1 variable Best with minimal number of categories Primary data encodings are area, lines, and points Used to show distributions and rank groups Strengths: Show density/distribution shape as well as individual data points and common summary statistics – so much information Works well with small datasets Weaknesses: A lot is going on Harder to interpret and cluttered or squished if there are more than a few groups Alternatives: Violin plot Boxplot (especially with jitter to show individual data points) Swarm plot Example plot The strengths of the plots that help you visualize distributions and compare groups Violin plots are good if you want to look at distribution characteristics (e.g., skew or multimodality) at a glance. Boxplots are great if you want to see the data and general summary statistics (e.g., median). Ridgeline plots are great at comparing distributions of lots of groups. Raincloud plots are great when you want to go deep and see everything for a small number of groups (exploratory analysis). 4.3.3 Group Composition, Complex Relationships, and Response Plots Of the conventional plots described above, scatter plots and line charts both fit within this category. Scatter plots are usually used to display a response as well as complex relationships while line charts may show a response or change over time. Plots within this category are more frequently expository data visualizations than exploratory data visualizations. These plots are often less intuitive for an audience to interpret without guidance. Therefore the polishing and refinement steps as well as including informative titles, captions, and labels are especially important when designing and building visualizations within this category. Stacked Bar Charts Description: Displays multiple categories within a single bar, stacked on top (vertical) or next to (horizontal) each other. Each overall bar represents a group. Within bars, each stack is a sub-category or subgroup. When to use: Numerical data with categorical data for groups Minimum of 2 variables Primary data encodings are bars, position, and color or pattern Used to find a ranking or change over time Compare sub-categories within a bar or consider how sub-category contribution to the total bar composition changes over time/across bars Avoid if you have a lot of sub-categories or want to compare individual sub-categories to each other If using more than a couple of categories, consider using proportions (that sum to 100%) on the numerical axis Strengths: Summarizes complex group composition in a compact way Can compare composition over time or across groups Weaknesses: Difficulty comparing subgroups that aren’t aligned or in the middle of the overall bar If one subgroup contributes too much, it can dwarf other subgroups; similarly, if the groups have uneven sizes, it can dwarf other groups If the numerical axis uses proportions, raw numbers aren’t visualized Alternatives: Grouped bar chart Lollipop plot Line chart A table A waterfall plot for the most important sub-category Example plot Example of the plot in the biomedical, bioinformatics, or cancer informatics literature https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9721/13/2/37 Heatmaps Description: A visualization (typically two dimensional – with rows and columns – of a table or matrix) using color. Always uses colors to display numbers or categories; the two dimensional matrix while typical is not a requirement, because the two dimensions could be a map projection or tissue sample. When to use: Categorical or numerical data or a mixture Minimum of 3 variables Primary data encodings are color and position Used to look at a distribution across samples or change over time/after an intervention May also exhibit pairwise correlation for many groups Not recommended if you need to know or display actual values Often used together with hierarchical clustering or reordering sample location to highlight trends or areas of similarity Strengths: Provides a broad overview to identify trends, areas of density, sparsity, or outliers Efficiently and compactly simplifies complex data into one visualization Weaknesses: The “matrix” aspect can be difficult for viewers to grasp Rearranging data can be helpful but also misleading if not described Actual values and summary stats are rare/difficult to display if there are many rows and columns Alternatives: A table Scatter plot Line plot Bubble charts if another dimension is needed Parallel plot Example plot Pairwise correlation: Full matrix vs lower triangle When using a heatmap to display pairwise correlation, the heatmap is symmetrical and presents redundant information (each correlation is displayed twice) because the correlation of A to B is the same as the correlation of B to A. The diagonal will always have perfect correlation because it’s comparing a sample or variable to itself. If looking at just the lower triangle, it presents the pairwise correlation only once and removes the redundant information. Sankey Diagrams Description: Represents the “flow” or movement of quantities (e.g., patients or samples) among different categories through different steps (e.g., demographics or steps of an analysis or trial) When to use: Categorical data and sometimes numerical data/counts Requires several variables Primary data encodings are lines, area, and color Used to show change over time Best with datasets with some sort of longitudinal data or time points with categories at each time point Example uses include tracking patient response or symptom trajectories as well as patient cohort stratification Strengths: Provides a lot of information about the study population and shows all possible paths Provides a visual or graphical representation of data that would otherwise be in a table or just described in text Weaknesses: Difficult or complex to interpret Flows that cross or overlap or flows with similar widths can be difficult to compare though interactivity can alleviate this Diagrams don’t always clearly and explicitly display sample dropout (discontinue treatment, etc.) Often require specialized tools to create visualization Alternatives: A table Stacked bar charts, but these lose the connection/possible path aspect Flowcharts Treemaps Other graphical visualizations or some custom made visualization Example plot The strengths of the plots for group composition, complex relationships, and response Stacked bar charts are good if you want to look at how subgroup composition changes at a glance over time, but it is less useful with lots of subgroups. Heatmaps are good if you have at least 3 variables that you need to visualize and want to use color as the primary means to communicate the point of the visualization (e.g., the range of values, correlation, areas of density, patterns across groups or time) Sankey diagrams are good if you want to look at the possible trajectories of symptoms, treatments, etc. and it’s important to know what combinations occur. 4.3.4 Field Standard Plots There are several common plots that are “field standard” or customarily used within the biomedical field. These plots (including Waterfall plots, Caterpillar plots, Kaplan-Meier curves, Volcano plots, MA diagrams, etc.) plots will be discussed in the final chapter. They often align with the category of group composition, complex relationships, and response plots. When deciding what plot is best for you and your research question, a field standard plot may be the answer given that the audience will be more familiar with such plots. 4.4 Galleries Galleries can be useful to browse standard plots and learn information about them. from Data to Viz Gallery: An example of a gallery that provides visual examples and explanations for necessary data types is the from Data to Viz gallery R Graph Gallery: The R Graph Gallery provides visual examples and templates for creating standard plots with the R programming language. Python Graph Gallery: The Python Graph Gallery provides visual examples and templates for creating standard plots with the Python programming language. SMART App Gallery: For more specialized galleries related to biomedical applications, consider the Substitutable Medical Apps, Reusable Technology (SMART) App Gallery which provides free and open source apps for healthcare providers and researchers to work with and visualize health data. The integrated apps describe specific data types and goals and can provide dashboards and visualizations specifically for those data types/goals. Genomics Data Visualization course website: The Genomics Data Visualization course website is another more specialized gallery from the Johns Hopkins University Fan lab which provides featured visualizations meant for working with large-scale single-cell and spatially-resolved omics datasets using R. Publications: Journal publications provide a myriad of example visualizations working with field specific data. Reading publications, studying their figures, and critically evaluating the design choices is a wonderful way to improve your own data visualization skills. In the near future, as you read journal articles and look at the figures, ask yourself the following questions: What was the goal or overarching message this visualization was meant to communicate? What was difficult for me to understand about this figure and what design choices could have made this figure easier for me to follow along? What did I like best about this visualization? Are these visualizations standard/common plot types or were there any new (at least to me) visualizations? What was unique about them? 4.5 Summary There are strengths and weaknesses to every kind of plot. Some plots are better for exploratory analysis than for sharing with wide audiences. If exact quantitative values need to be considered, don’t underestimate the power of a good table. When preparing an expository visualization, focus on one message. Choosing which plot to use may be field, context, and data dependent. Use the simplest or most mainstream plot you can! Make sure that the plot works with your data type(s), number of variables, number of observations (e.g., patients or samples), and the overall goal or research question. Use design tools to develop your visualization before switching to a more complex plot. These design tools include utilizing facets or subplots, dashed lines and text labels, and varying colors, textures, or shapes. Finally, consider browsing a visualization gallery for inspiration!

Caterpillar plots are practically the same as Forest plots except for one major difference: the categories are ordered by magnitude of the point estimates. When to use: Numerical data &amp; categorical data Several variables are required Primary data encodings are points and lines Used to find a ranking or for meta-analyses or comparing models or odds ratios Strengths: Provides comparison to a reference line (e.g., baseline or null effect) Efficient readability since values are ordered by magnitude Displays variation both intra- and inter-study Weaknesses: Cluttered and difficult to read if lots of studies or models are included A lot of context and information are in the axis labels Plot is just showing the effect estimates and uncertainty but no further context such as bias Alternatives: Funnel plot Heatmap Example plot Interpretation 6.1.3 Waterfall Plot Description: Bar charts which show treatment effect. The numerical axis is compared to a baseline. The bars are arranged or ordered according to magnitude and each bar typically corresponds to a different patient or sample. When to use: Numerical data (may have categorical data for color) Minimum of 1 variable if the difference between patient/sample and baseline is already computed, but a minimum of 2 variables otherwise Primary data encodings are bars and position Typically used to show patient response to a treatment but the design can be used for other use cases around this theme Strengths: Displays patient or sample response heterogeneity within one snapshot Weaknesses: The snapshot compares two time points but not a range of time For tumor response, there’s an accepted notion of what above or below the baseline means but this might not be true for other applications Alternatives: Spider plot incorporates time Swimmer plot incorporates time but loses the comparison to baseline Forest or Caterpillar plots can be use for treatment effect Kaplan-Meier curves can be used for outcome Heatmaps can be used to incorporate time How could a heatmap be an alternative plot? Each row would be a patient (y-axis) and the columns could be time. Use color to communicate the change from baseline. Perhaps consider faceting or arranging samples according to response category.
